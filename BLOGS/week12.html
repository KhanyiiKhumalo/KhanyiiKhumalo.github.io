        <p><b>Continue writing about your development process. You could reflect on the following:</b><br>
          <b> Start investigating APIs.</b><br>
          The term API refers to the Application Programming Interface. It's a collection of rules and protocols that let various software programs to communicate and interact with one another. APIs describe the techniques and data formats available to programs for requesting and exchanging data.
          APIs allow developers to have access to the functionality and resources of another software system or service without having to grasp the minutiae of its implementation. They give apps a standardized way to make requests, retrieve data, and conduct particular activities.
          APIs are intended to give a clear interface for working with a certain software component, service, or platform. They provide the inputs and outputs, data structures, and methods available to developers for accessing and manipulating the underlying functionality. By using existing code and services, developers may save time and effort while building more complex and powerful apps.
          
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>What kind of API do you feel would add value to your website? </b><br>
                
          •	LinkedIn API: By integrating the LinkedIn API into my portfolio website, I may display my professional profile, employment experience, and education. This increases my trustworthiness and allows people to connect with me on LinkedIn more quickly.<br>
          •	Behance or Dribbble API: Because I am a designer and artist, I may present may portfolio work directly on my website by integrating APIs from sites like Behance or Dribbble. This enables prospective clients or employers to see my work and get a sense of my design style and originality.<br>
          •	Social Media APIs: By integrating APIs from social media networks like Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook, I may display my most recent social media postings, follower counts, or engagement data on my portfolio website. This might assist me in establishing my online presence and encouraging people to engage with me on social media.<br>

            </p>
            <p>
                <b>What are the technical challenges you foresee?</b><br>
                The technological hurdle would be getting an API key, often known as 0Auth, which is required for all open APIs to function.

            <p><b>Reflection on "Traveling While Trans" from Costanza-Chock, S. (2020) Design Justice: Community-Led Practices to Build the Worlds We Need. Cambridge, MA, USA: MIT Press (Information Policy)</b><br>
              The chapter "Traveling While Trans" in the book "Design Justice: Community-Led Practices to Build the Worlds We Need" really gets you thinking. It discusses the difficulties and obstacles that transgender individuals have when traveling and underlines the significance of fairness in design in order to build settings that accommodate everyone.
              Sasha Costanza-Chock, the author, takes us on a trip through the lives of trans people on the road. They describe how trans persons are frequently subjected to prejudice, harassment, and even violence when traveling. From dealing with airport security to using facilities and obtaining accommodations, trans people confront a variety of problems that may be emotionally and physically draining.
              "Traveling While Trans" highlights the difficulties that trans individuals confront and advocates for a more empathetic and inclusive design approach. It serves as a reminder that design is not neutral, and that we must address the perspectives of underrepresented populations. It's about making the world a safe and comfortable place for everyone, regardless of gender identification.
              In summary, this chapter encourages us to consider how design might either promote or fight inequality. It pushes us to examine our prejudices and privileges, as well as to actively interact with groups who are frequently overlooked. We can strive toward a society in which everyone may travel with dignity and without fear by practicing design justice.
