        <p><b>Continuing the Development of my website:</b><br>
          I still believe in APIs that connect viewers to my numerous portfolios and pages. 
          I'm having trouble selecting where this would offer the most value to my site. 
          I could add them to my homepage at the bottom of the screen to make them visible, 
          but I also need to determine if I want to use basic icons to direct readers to my profiles
           or maybe create a column that displays my profiles.

                <b>Reflections on Readings:<br>
                  Design Justice:</b><br>
                
          "Design Justice" is a novel approach to design that directly addresses the issue of inequality. It acknowledges that design decisions may either perpetuate or challenge existing power disparities. Costanza-Chock's observations reveal that design is far from neutral. It has tremendous ethical concerns and the capacity to alter society.
          The emphasis on inclusion and justice is what distinguishes Design Justice. It encourages designers to recognize their own biases and privileges and to work actively to eliminate oppressive institutions. This entails integrating and respecting underrepresented populations in the design process. Designers may guarantee that their work satisfies the various requirements and goals of different groups by doing so.
           In essence, Design Justice is a rallying cry for designers to make a good effect on society. It understands that design can be a strong weapon for social change. Design Justice has the capacity to remodel our society into a more fair and inclusive one by questioning power systems, advocating for equity, and promoting the well-being of all persons, especially those who have traditionally been excluded.

                <b> Digital Society:</b><br>
               
          Digital technology has completely transformed our lives, making everything quicker and more linked. We live in a "Digital Society," in which our phones, computers, and the internet play a significant part in how we do things.
          This digital revolution has undeniably positive aspects. We can talk to anybody, anywhere, at any time. We can find knowledge and learn new things in an instant. And there are a slew of exciting new options for businesses and entrepreneurs.
          But it's not all rainbows and unicorns. We, too, have some major concerns to deal with. Our privacy and security are under threat, and large corporations and governments are amassing massive amounts of data on us. It's as though we're continuously being observed.
          Let us not forget that not everyone has equal access to the digital world. Some folks cannot afford the latest technology or may not have stable internet connections. So, while some of us are succeeding in the digital age, others are falling behind.

          When we evaluate the "Digital Society," we must consider both the positive and the negative. We need to develop methods to secure our privacy, ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to participate, and use technology to make the world a better place for everyone.
