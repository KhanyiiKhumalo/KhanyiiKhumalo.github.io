        <p><b>Write more about your development method in the future. You could think about:
          Relationships between your CSS, HTML, and JS</b><br>
          HTML texts are styled and formatted with the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) language. A web page's 
          aesthetic appearance is controlled by CSS, whereas HTML determines its structure and content.The attributes 
          of HTML components, such as layout, colors, fonts, and spacing, are decided by CSS, which chooses the HTML 
          elements and applies styles to them. The HTML content can be shown and customized. In order to make web pages 
          more interactive, programmers utilize JavaScript (JS). Both dynamic HTML and CSS manipulation are supported. 
          Using JS, you may alter CSS styles in response to user input or other circumstances, enabling animations, 
          visibility toggles, and layout changes.In conclusion, HTML offers structure, CSS takes care of visual display, 
          and JavaScript brings interaction to web sites. Build and improve websites and online apps by combining these three technologies.

          <b>Are there any aspects of your coding process that you should be mindful of when considering how important our code is in digital colonialisms?</b><br>
          When contemplating the role of code in the context of digital colonialism, it is critical to keep some fundamental characteristics of the coding process in mind:
          •	Recognize and resolve any biases in code to promote inclusion and diversity in development.<br>
          •	Power Dynamics: Consider how code might perpetuate current power dynamics and disparities while promoting equitable access and empowerment.<br>
          •	Data Collection and Privacy: To protect individuals' rights and prevent repeating previous patterns of exploitation, provide openness, informed consent, and strong privacy safeguards.<br>
          •	Local Empowerment entails involving local people, adapting code to their requirements, and encouraging cooperation and information sharing.<br>
          •	Openness and Accessibility: Promote open-source principles and accessibility in order to empower others and lower entry barriers.<br>
          •	Ethical Considerations: In the coding process, prioritize ethical ideals, human rights, and sustainability.
