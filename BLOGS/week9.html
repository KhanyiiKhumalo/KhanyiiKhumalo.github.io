          My website's coding might use some improvement, so I've started looking at that. 
          I now know how this would be accomplished with JavaScript thanks to the technical
         presentations. Along with that, I've been figuring out how to incorporate the JavaScript 
         excersises into my website.  After submitting, I made some adjustments to my website that
         I had discovered needed improvement. Prior to the third assignment's submission, I've spent
         some time examining areas that can or should be improved. Additionally, I have been improving 
         the design area of my website as well as my wireframes. I have also been making sure that when 
         I upload my website to GitHub that it does not give me problems.

                <b> Magenya - 2020 - Making a Feminist Internet in Africa Why the inte.pdf</b><br>
        The article "Making a Feminist Internet in Africa: Why the Internet Needs African Feminists and Feminisms" by Magenya raises important questions about the role of African feminists in establishing the continent's digital culture. African feminists, according to the author, are essential to the cause of gender equality, to the dismantling of patriarchal systems, and to making the internet a secure and liberating environment for women and girls.
        The next section of the article addresses the unique difficulties that African women and girls have in utilizing and accessing the internet. These include problems like access to technology, literacy, and cost as well as cultural barriers that may make it difficult for women and girls to use the internet in a secure and empowering manner. According to the author, these issues need to be addressed if African feminists are to make the digital world more accessible and inclusive.
        The article also emphasizes the significance of developing a feminist internet that dispels gender stereotypes and encourages favourable portrayals of women and girls. The author makes the case that this may be accomplished through programs like online feminist media platforms, digital literacy classes for women and girls, and efforts to combat online harassment and violence against women.
        Finally, the article highlights the significance of African feminists in influencing international discussions on internet governance and regulation. The author contends that African feminists should oppose prevailing ideologies and work to advance laws that advance women's rights and gender equality.
        "Making a Feminist Internet in Africa: Why the Internet Needs African Feminists and Feminisms" is a strong call to action for African feminists to actively participate in reshaping the continent's digital environment. The essay emphasizes the internet's potential to advance feminism, but it also emphasizes the difficulties and disparities that need to be fixed if women and girls in Africa are to find the internet to be a secure and empowering environment.
