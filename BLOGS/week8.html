        <p><b>Think about the webpage you provided for Assignment 1. 
          What happened? </b><br>
          Although when designing and creating my website everything that  I wanted and I had hoped
          for came to life and I was really pleased with my overall results of my website and how
          everything displayed. From my colour scheme to the fonts and how easy navigating the page
          was I was really happy with it. The only problem though for me was that when I put everything 
          onto GitHub my pages where not working and showing and I didn’t know how to fix it due to the 
          fact that I had never used GitHub before. It took me 2 days to try and correct the issue and 
          still I couldn’t. so I fear this might be a issue when marking as the markers may not be able 
          to see the work and effort that I have put into the website.

          <b>Reading One - Graham et al. - 2015 - Towards a study of information geographies</b><br>
          The Graham et al. article "Towards a study of information geographies" investigates the link
          between information and geography and how this influences access to information in various 
          regions of the world. The authors contend that knowledge is not equally disseminated around
          the world and that geographic location, economic growth, and cultural variations all have 
          an impact on who has access to it. In the context of web development, the paper also emphasizes
          how crucial it is to comprehend information geography. It highlights the necessity for web 
          designers to take into account the diverse information requirements of people throughout the 
          globe and create websites that are relevant and accessible to them. This article underlines 
          the significance of taking into account South Africa's particular information geography as a
          South African web developer. This entails being aware of the geographic, cultural, and economic 
          aspects of the nation that affect information availability. For instance, to create websites that
          are mobile-friendly, web designers must take into account the increasing rates of mobile device
          usage in South Africa. The article emphasizes the significance of comprehending information geographies 
          and their influence on information access in its entirety. This implies that while developing websites, 
          South African web developers must take into account the distinctive information geography of the nation 
          and make sure that they are usable and pertinent to local consumers.

                <b>Reading Two - Ballatore et al. - 2017 - Digital Hegemonies The Localness of Search Engine</b><br>              
          The article "Digital Hegemonies: The Localness of Search Engine" by Ballatore et al. investigates how search 
          engines affect the localness of the internet and affect how consumers perceive the online environment. Because 
          they regulate information access and have an impact on the development of online communities, the authors contend 
          that search engines are significant players in determining the digital landscape. The article highlights how search 
          engines affect website creation. The design and optimization of websites for search engine algorithms can be influenced 
          by search engines, which presents difficulties for web developers in countries like South Africa. This is especially 
          important since popular search engines could not fully represent regional context and user demands, making it
          challenging to optimize webpages appropriately. In order to develop websites that effectively serve local customers' 
          demands, designers must take into account the preferences of regional search engines. This involves taking into
          account elements like the user's language, cultural environment, and particular search phrases. The significance 
          of comprehending search engine localization and how it affects web development in South Africa is emphasized in 
          the article. Web designers may design websites that effectively serve the demands of South African customers 
          and help to the expansion of the region's digital market by taking into account local search engine preferences, 
          language, cultural context, and mobile optimization.
            </p>
            <p><b>Consider the connections between the two texts and how they affect your perspective on web development as a South African.</b><br>
              The articles "Towards a study of information geographies" and "Digital Hegemonies: The Localness of Search Engine" provide light on the 
              connection between information, geography, and online development. When creating websites, South African web developers must take the 
              regional context into account. The authors of the study Graham et al. underline how geographic location, economic progress, and cultural 
              diversity all affect how easily people may obtain information. To design websites that are appropriate for many ethnic groups, mobile-friendly, 
              and accessible, web designers must take these elements into account.
              The impact of search engines on the digital environment and how this impacts web development is highlighted in the essay by Ballatore et al. 
              South African web developers must take the preferences of regional search engines into account and optimize webpages accordingly. 
              This entails taking into account the local user's language, cultural setting, and particular search phrases.
              These articles collectively stress how crucial it is to comprehend the local context while creating websites 
              in South Africa. Web designers may build useful websites that support the expansion of the digital environment 
              and guarantee that all users have equal access to information by taking into consideration the distinctive 
              information geography of the nation and the preferences of local search engines.
