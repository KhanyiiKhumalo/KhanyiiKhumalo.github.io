          <p><b>My experience continuing the development of my website</b><br>
              The development of my website has been good so far. I've come to understand how crucial 
              wireframes are. Otherwise, I would have to assemble my website haphazardly, and that would 
              just cause confusion and clouding my head with too many ideas and possibilities. I've also 
              been considering various approaches to developing my wireframes. I began by sketching it out 
              on paper and then put my annotated notes all over. Now Iâ€™m trying to digitalize my wireframes
              and make them look for sexy. I need to revise my website's objective in light of this week's
              lectures and readings in order to better serve the user. Initially, I based my design on
              aesthetics I liked and had come across while researching. My knowledge of fresh opportunities for
              the website was greatly expanded by the JavaScript lessons. 
              </p>
              <p>
                  <b>How do my wireframes hold up against the reading and lectures on UI?</b><br>
                  This week, we looked more closely at the user interface (UI), specifically how it serves as the 
                  system's means of communication when an interaction occurs. Each UI element consists of a Signifier
                  (what the user sees) and a Signified (what the element does).  Without giving it any time or consideration,
                  I had based the most of my design on another website. After the lecture, my view on what I wanted for my 
                  website largely shifted. My wireframe has to be modified in accordance with the UI and the experiences I want my users to have.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <b>How does the UI relate to how we define interactivity?</b><br>
                  This week, we looked more closely at the user interface, specifically how it serves as the system's 
                  communication channel when interaction occurs. When it comes to defining UI and interaction, they are as 
                  follows: A graphical representation of a software or system that allows people to interact with it is referred
                  to as a user interface (UI). Interactivity refers to how and to what extent the user may engage with the UI and
                  the system it represents. Interactivity is related to UI since the interface expresses, allows, and embodies
                  interaction. As users engage with the system to get a source of response (output), the UI not only shows how
                   users may interact with the system, but it also communicates/provides feedback on the sought result.
