        <p><b>Your experience setting up Git.</b><br>
            The setup of Github was easy and seamless but a bit confusing if you didn’t know where to 
            look. As someone who has never used Github, I didn’t know where to look so signup 
             because it was so small and tucked away in the corner of the screen. But once you are set
              up and an interesting display of the galaxy takes over your screen it just plays around with 
               the application and tries to figure it out. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Reflection on the readings. </b><br>
                The 3 readings I read were informative but I found the terminology confusing and got lost at some 
                stages, to the point where I would read a sentence over again to try and understand. After doing 
                some research on the internet about the readings and their perspective authors then only did I start 
                to understand more. I think I could look more into the readings in the future and possibly ask others for
                 their feedback and how they understood the readings.

                <b>Your goals for this course.</b><br>
                My goals for this course are as follows:<br>
                •	Get 70% overall <br>
                •	Complete all exercises on time <br>
                •	Submit all assignments and essays on time <br>
                •	Take in as much content as possible <br>
                •	Learn the necessary skills and practices to make a good website 
            </p>
            <p><b>What I did on the internet</b><br>
                This week I mostly was on my social media platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and shopping websites.
                I wouldn’t say any of these platforms were productive or offered me any inspiration for a future website but all of
                them functioned in different ways. All have in common the function of scrolling aimlessly over pictures or videos until
                 you settle on one for a few minutes.
