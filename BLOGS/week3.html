          <p><b>My experience continuing the development of my website </b><br>
              I've been able to deepen my knowledge and comprehension of web development by continuing my expertise 
              in website development and studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am now acquainted with the different
              tools and methods that can be used in web development. Understanding the significance of using the
              appropriate tools and methods for the job at hand has helped me decide when to apply them. Making 
              this website completely responsive and offering a fantastic user experience to the user is one of my
              major priorities. Additionally, I want it to be visually appealing so that it can reflect my character
              and who I am. Overall, I've been able to comprehend web programming better and learn how to build a 
              website from start. Using the tools and methods at my disposal, I was able to design a user-friendly, 
              engaging, and aesthetically pleasing website.

                  <b>Reflection on the reading and understanding of UI/UX </b><br>
                  A work on the subject of context's importance in literary interpretation is Standard and Context,
                  by Mailloux, published in 1983. It investigates how reading a work in a particular setting can have 
                  an impact on conventions, or the typical methods of understanding a text. According to Mailloux,
                  context is essential to understanding a document. Conventions are not fixed; rather, they can be 
                  interpreted in different ways depending on the reader's situation. Additionally, he talks about the 
                  connections between social and literary norms, emphasizing the value of knowing a text's social setting 
                  in order to fully comprehend its meaning. As learning Web developers we can learn a range of principles 
                  about designing user interfaces that work from Mailloux (1983). Mailloux concentrates on the use of 
                  conventions in user interfaces to establish a feeling of context that can aid users in comprehending the
                  goal and functionality of a website or application. He places emphasis on how conventions can be used
                  to improve the usability of a website or application and can help users make choices and direct their behavior.

                  <b>Thoughts of course material </b><br>
                  Usually, I think it's helpful to look at the same piece from different angles. It sometimes makes sense to 
                  read the related supplementary material, in my opinion, if there are ideas in the technical lessons that I do 
                  not comprehend. I feel like I'm revising my work for the week by watching the previous classes. Since the material 
                  is being given from a variety of perspectives, I am also learning more about it. It's advantageous, in my opinion, 
                  that we have access to classes that present various viewpoints on the subject. My comprehension of the task is greatly
                  enhanced by watching them. Your vantage point is widened, and you are given the opportunity to consider ideas or issues
                  from various angles.
