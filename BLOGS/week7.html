          <p><b>My experience continuing the development of my website:.</b><br>
              In all honesty, despite the frustrations I've experienced when my 
              design or code refused to cooperate with me, I discovered that I genuinely
              liked developing my website. I genuinely built a website from scratch, which 
              is truly mind-boggling because I never imagined I'd be able to do so.  I had to 
              update certain components of my website, but the adjustments were minor because they 
              only comprised modest navigation choices that I wanted to add. I needed to do this 
              since I needed to consider UX and UI. Some layouts seemed better in theory but not in practice.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <b>IxD Process: </b><br>
                  All the information required for this question can be found in the Design Section
                  I considered the flow of my website. As a way of simple navigation for the user,
                  I aim to have a header that is continuously visible (at least in desktop mode).
                  I'm aiming to make each of my pages internally familiar, since this will help the 
                  user rapidly become acclimated to the structure of my website, and I'll employ 
                  exterior familiarity features to provide the user with a smooth experience when 
                  browsing my website for the first time.

                  <b>Reflection on this weeks readings?</b><br>
                  After reading Hassenzahl and Tractinsky's 2006 work "User Experience - A Research Agenda,"
                  user experience design is the major issue. The reading gave an informative review of user 
                  experience in regard to traditional usability problems in order to investigate the emotional 
                  and social components of user engagement with products and services. The author's definition of
                  UX as a "momentary, primarily feeling" of engaging with a product or service helped me understand 
                  that UX is about more than simply functionality, but also the user's emotional response to the encounter.
