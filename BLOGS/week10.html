        <p><b>Continue writing about your development process. You could reflect on the following:What changes have you had to make to your website to incorporate JavaScript?</b><br>
          This week, I concentrated on putting the ideas I discussed in my previous blog into practice. This includes displaying my blogs on my website in a more engaging and dynamic 
          fashion as well as improving the usability and responsiveness of the entire website. I looked back on and got assistance from the JavaScript exercises. This not only made it
          simpler to traverse my website, but it also improved the efficiency of my code.

                <b>Birhane and Guest - 2020 - Towards decolonising computational sciences.pdf</b><br>
          The paper makes the case that Western epistemologies and methodologies have dominated computational 
          science, leading to a constrained and exclusive approach that does not adequately reflect the range 
          of experiences and viewpoints throughout the world. The authors offer a paradigm for decolonizing 
          computational science that includes acknowledging the limits of Western epistemologies, connecting 
          with local knowledge and practices, and encouraging diversity and inclusion in the field. The paper
          underlines the necessity of increased cultural sensitivity and inclusion in research and stresses the 
          value of involving many viewpoints and knowledge systems. Because it questions preconceptions and prejudices 
          and emphasizes the value of a variety of sources, I found this essay to be thought-provoking as a language model.
